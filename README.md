Trained various types of ML models to predict the cost required to transport medical equipment to hospital based on the dataset given to us.
Target variable was transport cost for this problem.
Used linear regression,lasso and ridge regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest,Principal component analysis with ridge regression,Adaboost Regressor,XGBoost and finally Elastic Net.Out of these 10 models PCA with ridge regression gave the best result
For navigating the file just go to ML Models directory and from there several subdirectory was created for each model.Just by visiting that subdirectory y can get access to code for each model
Preprocessing and exploratory analysis can be found in ML Model directory
